Assistant,Bot,2024-07,0,"Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and rapid delivery of working software. The key principles of agile methodology include:
Advantages of Agile Methodology:
Adaptability: Agile allows teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and market conditions, enabling them to adapt their plans and priorities as needed.
Faster Time-to-Market: By breaking down projects into smaller, manageable iterations, agile teams can deliver working software more frequently, often in a matter of weeks or months.
Improved Collaboration: Agile emphasizes close collaboration between the development team, stakeholders, and customers, leading to better alignment and understanding of project goals.
Higher Quality: Agile's focus on continuous testing and integration helps identify and address issues early in the development process, resulting in higher-quality software.
Increased Transparency: Agile methods, such as daily standups and sprint reviews, provide greater visibility into the development process, allowing for better project management and decision-making.
Disadvantages of Agile Methodology:
Resistance to Change: Some organizations and team members may be reluctant to adopt agile practices, especially if they are used to more traditional, waterfall-based approaches.
Lack of Upfront Planning: Agile's emphasis on iterative development can make it challenging to create detailed long-term plans and roadmaps, which some organizations may prefer.
Potential for Scope Creep: The flexibility of agile can also lead to continuous changes in requirements, which can result in scope creep and difficulty in managing project timelines and budgets.
Increased Coordination Effort: Agile requires close collaboration and communication between team members, which can be more challenging in larger, distributed teams.
Potential for Technical Debt: The rapid delivery of working software in agile can sometimes lead to corners being cut, resulting in technical debt that needs to be addressed in the future.
Overall, agile methodology provides a flexible and responsive approach to software development, but it may not be the best fit for all organizations or project types, depending on their specific needs and constraints."
Oliver Dolan,10 Years Commercial Software Engineering,2017,11,"The agile methodology is based around the agile manifesto, the original definition can be seen here: Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
If you navigate through the principles you will see some common themes:
The stakeholders needs are prioritised
To achieve this we must decide who the stakeholders are

Oliver Dolan's answer to How do I get started on a agile project management?
Oliver Dolan's answer to What are the steps in creating a software?
Oliver Dolan's answer to How we can increase corporate agility?
The delivery times are squeezed which aids to identify weak corporate processes
Information learned on the way is visible and accounted for in future plans
Continuous improvement is a big focus using PDCA cycles. (plan, do check & act)
As for the advantages and disadvantages these are often
Subjective
It depends on your view point and where in the organisation you are situated.
Developers tend to favour agile
Project managers or team leaders not so much as there role and importance can become eroded.
Industry specific
Depending on industry agile methodologies will have varied applicability
It was designed for software so its heavily applied in software engineering
We are only now in 2017 starting to see other industries adopt some of the ideas.
Implementation specific - This is huge, infact this might be the most important
Who is commanding the implementation
Obviously if someone is making foolish decisions at a high level of management it can be seen in the results of the business.

As for the advantages and disadvantages I have decided to keep this simple and to the point so as to answer the question as best as possible.
Advantages
Faster cycle times
Speed to market
Improving quality through continuous improvement
Enhanced visibility of what teams are doing
Easier to react to business changes
Reduced risk due to greater visibility and more adaptability
Customer satisfaction due to being more involved and listened to
Product market fit becomes more probable due to feedback cycles
Teams often like the process
Teams start performing better due to PDCA cycles
Highlights problems early
True prioritisation as stories are often small enough to do prioritisation effectively
Seeing the benefits of work undertaken sooner
Team feels more united due to team commitments and cross functionality
It allows for identification of wasteful processes
Faster feedback from the stakeholders
Stakeholders are more engaged as they are more likely to get what they want and change it before using too many resources.
Higher quality due to squeezed delivery times
More transparency throughout the value stream
Less documentation to maintain
Higher chance of working solution due to automated acceptance criteria testing
Maintenance is easier
Disadvantages
Oliver Dolan's answer to In a nutshell, why do a lot of developers dislike Agile? What are better project management paradigm alternatives?
Stories can be hard to slice
Customer expectations on quality can be damaged with MVP approach
Micromanagement
Lots of meetings
Agile projects can be hard to agree contractually
Stakeholder dissatisfaction with priorities
The teams doing the work can feel dis empowered
Lack of understanding of the agile methods in depth at different corporate levels
Yearning for the past of agreed specifications and budgets
Lack of clarity on what will be available when
Backlog can be difficult to prioritize
It can also become huge
The terminology can be confusing
Story points, velocity, burndown, value stream etc..
It can abstract the organisation from the team
Listening to the customer is not always in the best interest of the business
It can be hard to distinguish the methodology's and when should be applied.
It is not a magic bullet to solve everything and can be oversold
It can reduce employee morale and satisfaction
It can dis empower individuals
It can be perceived as cultist and egocentric
Scaleability can be difficult to get correct
There are lots of things I could write but these are the main ones I can think of right now.
Hopefully it helps
Good Luck
Oliver Dolan!"
Murray Robinson,Works at IE Digital,2018,48,"Agile is not a methodology. It is a philosophy of work with a set of values, principles, frameworks and methods. Here are what I see are it’s weaknesses.
Agile is open and honest. That makes its bad for managers who get ahead through deceit and manipulation.
Agile empowers the team. This means that its a threat to authoritarian managers who threaten, control and intimidate staff and each other to get what they want.
Agile is about breaking down the barriers between functional silos. So its not good for people who are building an empire of functional specialists
Agile is about working together in co-located, cross functional teams. This makes agile a threat to offshore, outsourcers in developing countries.
Agile is a fundamental change in the philosophy of work which requires changes in an organisations values, principles, frameworks and processes. This means that agile cannot be implemented over night. It needs at least two years to get the full benefits.
When Agile is implemented in one area such as development it immediately exposes serious problems in the areas around development which managers have been successfully hiding for many years. They dont like being exposed and will often push back hard.
If you only implement agile in the dev team you get little benefit from it. You only get the full benefits of agile when you apply it to your whole product development lifecycle.
Agile has been turned into a big money making business by some certification authorities. This has led to Scrum becoming arrogant and dogmatic.
The revenue from Agile consulting has led to a lot of big name, consulting firms selling agile without understanding it. This has led to people like the OP thinking that agile is just another methodology or process."
Sasha Andrieiev,CEO at Jelvix (2011–present),2020,29,"The core value of Agile development is that it enhances the quality and predictability of the team workflow. It helps to get a quicker return and improves the quality of responsiveness. Scrum and Kanban are the two most widely used Agile methodologies.
Agile software development is based on iterative development. All the requirements and solutions are being developed only through the collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.
About the advantages:
Agile methods or Agile processes help to streamline the project management process;
They are based on such key points as encouraging procurement and adaptation, leadership philosophy, teamwork, and self-organization;
The rapid delivery of high-quality software is facilitated by accountability to best design practices;
This business approach connects development with customer needs and company goals.
Drawbacks of agile methodologies:
More time and commitment. Testers, customers, and developers must constantly interact closely with each other. All participants must be prepared for quick testing and logout at each stage. This guarantees the quality of the product, meanwhile, the team’s workflow will become longer and more difficult;
Greater demands on developers and clients. This system requires a great return on each of the participants to the entire project to ensure success. Customers need to be trained to facilitate product development. Even a minimal lack of customer involvement will affect the quality and success of the software.
If you are still thinking about whether to implement Agile, here is an article on how to implement the most common agile project metrics."
Keshav,Content Writer | Software Developer,2021,0,"Agile methodology is a project management system that relies on incremental development. Each iteration consists of two- to four-week sprints, where each sprint's goal is to build the most important features first and come out with a potentially deliverable product. More features are built into the product in subsequent sprints and are adjusted based on stakeholder and customer feedback between sprints. Whereas other project management methods emphasize building an entire product in one iteration from start to finish, agile scrum methodology focuses on delivering several iterations of a product to provide stakeholders with the highest business value in the least amount of time. Agile methodology has several benefits. It encourages products to be built faster since each set of goals must be completed within each sprint's time frame. It also requires frequent planning and goal setting, which helps the scrum team focus on the current sprint's objectives and increase productivity.
The greatest benefit of agile methodology is its flexibility. With the sprint-based model, the scrum team typically receives feedback from stakeholders after each sprint. If there are any problems or changes, the scrum team can easily and quickly adjust product goals during future sprints to provide more valuable iterations. This way, stakeholders are happier because they get exactly what they want after being involved every step of the way.
Advantages-
1. Superior quality product: In Agile project management, testing is an integrated part of the project execution phase which means that the overall quality of the final product is greater. The client remains involved in the development process and can ask for changes depending on the market realities. Since Agile is an iterative process, project teams keep on learning and growing with time and continue improving.
2. Customer satisfaction: In Agile, the customer is always involved in the decision-making process which leads to greater customer retention. In the traditional framework, the customer is only involved in the planning phase and does not influence execution which affects flexibility and adaptability. By keeping the customer in the loop and making changes according to their feedback, you deliver value to the customer and ensure that the final product is truly according to their requirements.
3. Faster ROI: The fact that agile development is iterative means that the features are delivered incrementally. Therefore, benefits are realized early while the product is in the development process. Long delivery cycles are often a problem for businesses, particularly those in fast-moving markets. Agile means fast product releases and the ability to gauge customer reaction and alter accordingly, keeping you ahead of the competition.
4. People and interactions are emphasized rather than processes and tools. Customers, developers, and testers constantly interact with each other.
5. A result-oriented team: Agile fosters an open culture of idea exchange and cooperation within teams. It spurs lively team collaboration, boosts morale, and clearly defines all the roles and responsibilities. Each and every member is in-the-know when it comes to pressing tasks and priorities.
Disadvantages-
1. Active user involvement and close collaboration are required throughout the development cycle. This is very engaging, rewarding, and ensures delivery of the right product. It’s the fundamental principle in agile that ensures expectations are well managed. And since the definition of failure is not meeting expectations, these are critical success factors for any project. However, these principles are very demanding on the user representative’s time and require a big commitment for the duration of the project.
2. Requirements emerge and evolve throughout the development. This creates the very meaning of agile – flexibility. Flexibility to change course as needed and to ensure delivery of the right product. There are two big flip sides to this principle though. One is the potential for scope creep, which we all know can create the risk of ever-lasting projects. The other is that there is much less predictability, at the start of the project, and during, about what the project is actually going to deliver. This can make it harder to define a business case for the project, and harder to negotiate fixed-price projects. Without the maturity of a strong and clear vision, and the discipline of fixing timescales and trading scope, this is potentially very dangerous.
3. Agile requirements are barely sufficient. This eliminates wasted effort on deliverables that don’t last (i.e. aren’t part of the finished product), which saves time and therefore money. Requirements are clarified just in time for development and can be documented in much less...

Mohanakrishnan Gopalakrishnan,"M Tech in Computer Science, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IITM) (Graduated 1987)",2024-06,0,"Let’s try answering this question through a parallel - of building a house in place of software development. Mapping the answers to the software domain should be straightforward.
Agile is like moving into a house while you are building that house. At the outset this might sound crazy, but this has many advantages and of course disadvantages.
Pro : You don’t have to wait for a couple of years to move in, you start enjoying the house early in the development cycle. Also you save on rent while building the house. Con: In the initial phase the house will be quite unliveable, you have to live through that. Also you are more involved in evolving the house on a day to day basis. This takes extra time from you compared to when you totally outsource the building work based on an approved plan.
Pro: You don’t have nasty surprises in the end - you keep finding and fixing issues and discomforts as you keep building
Pro: You don’t need to have a grand plan in the beginning to start building. If you are not a grand plan person, this is your cup of tea. You start discovering what you need as you start living in the house and you keep building the top priority features at that point. This helps you discover the needs as you go by. Con: If you are a grand plan person, you would hate this. Also, if you are really good at dreaming up the ideal house, and won’t have to make much changes to that plan, you will have a more optimal design if you start with the grand plan.
Pro: As a person living in the house, you are able to provide continuous, lived-in feedback every small change that is getting added to the house. This is a million times better than the kind of feedback you would be able to give looking at engineering drawings of the house. Con: If you are too fickle minded, you might keep changing your requirements and you might end up spending much more on scope creep than otherwise."
Jessica Wood,"M.tech in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics (science grouping), Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST) (Graduated 2010)",2020,1,"Hi,
Agile is the methodology where the software project is broken into several small stages and these are managed by a team with constant collaboration and continuous iteration and improvement.
In simpler words, it is the iterative approach that effectively focuses on customer feedback, constant changes, collaboration, with rapid releases.
Agile effectively targets software development and follows the shift-left principle. Also, it focuses on functional and non-functional readiness.
There are several benefits that are achieved for enterprises with agile. The most important benefit is that it offers shorter development cycle with enhanced detect detection.
Along with the advantages, there is even other side, i.e. the challenges. Yes, Agile even lays down challenges that should be considered while practice agile testing.
The most important challenge with agile methodology is that it is difficult for the teams to be more productive every time.
Thanks!"
Victor Malyavko,QA evangelist | Cherish DEV Founder,2022,3,"Agile is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration, responsibility, and openness. It is a technique for development management that stresses iterative and incremental development, and early delivery of functioning software. The Agile methodology relies on rapid and frequent deliveries of working software that allows teams to respond to changes in requirements, rather than planning everything in advance. The components are adaptive planning, evolutionary progress, and collaborative rewards. The process covers the full software development cycle, from requirements to deployment and maintenance.
Advantages:
Reduced time to market — adaptability and constant communication make the final product as clear as possible, which reduces the time for its testing.
Creativity — using a variety of minds and constantly solving complex problems leads to the creation of innovative approaches to product testing.
Meeting the requirements of the customer and the expectations of the end user — the continuous communication of developers, testers, businessmen and users leads to the creation of an ideal hit on the goals of the product.
Changes even at late stages — this can be achieved as painlessly as possible due to the fact that the testing process is divided into sprints, as well as through communication within the team (each member knows the product well).
Quickly identifying wrong approaches and making quick decisions — this can be achieved through daily communication of team members.
Disadvantages
Creating stress fear of uncertainty — team members can be frustrated knowing that the changes can be made during the last stages of development;
Degradation of quality — Agile is fast and has a large volume, so the quality may become lower.
Long time to implement — Agile is a complex methodology that can be a problem;
Stress for customers — not everyone is ready for daily meetings and problem-solving that they hoped to delegate to others.
Strong motivation of employees and professionalism at the same level are required — QA Engineers must keep up with each other in a rapidly changing, flexible software testing process, and this is difficult to achieve with insufficient motivation and qualifications of at least one of the team.

Anand Singh,QA Manager,2022,0,"Hi,

Agile Model/Methodology is one of the procedure followed while software development and testing for the products. In short, It is a concept being used in SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle). Agile Methodology is an iterative and incremental approach, where the features keep on adding and as a company should ensure it is flexible enough to handle it and deliver it within a short period of time to gain customer's satisfaction.

Examples of approaches to agile model are:
1) Scrum
2) Kanban
3) Extreme Programming (XP)
4) Feature Driven Development (FDD)
5) Adaptive Software Development Method(ASDM)
In most of the companies providing 'software qa services are using ""Scrum"" and ""Extreme Programming"" methodlogies
It is very common now a days that most of the Software companies follows agile methodology. I have consolidated advantages and disadvantages below:

Advantages/Principles of Agile Method:
1) Product release process will become very fast
2) Requirement changes are allowed at any stage of Agile Model
3) Main Goal is Customer's Satisfaction
4) There will be a good communication between Customers, Business Analyst, Developers and Test Engineers
5) It is a very Easy Model to adapt
Disadvantages of Agile Model:
1) There will be less focus on Designing and Documentation as it plays a major role in Waterfall model.
2) Final product is not released first
3) Long-term projects suffer due to incremental delivery.
4) Difficult to handle
5) Sign-off at every phase is required to allow developers to move forward.
Hope the above information will help you.
Thanks,
Anand"
Anand Kumar,Startup Specialist (2014–present),2021,78,"Agile methodology, in simple terms, means a guidance path for the companies to work efficiently. The idea is to adapt to the change instead of clinging to your plan. It’s about being responsive to the changing market and the customers, adapt and grow.
Yes, just like the word Implies, it can help your work progress quickly and easily. It follows simple four ideas:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools: Humans perform software development; therefore the quality of interaction between them is vital. Though tools are an important part of software development, focusing more on teamwork regardless of the tools the team uses makes great software.
Working software over comprehensive documentation: For users and coworkers, documentation can be a great resource. However, software development aims to build software that delivers business benefits rather than vast documentation.
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: The software development team communicates with customers frequently. By listening to and getting their feedback, the team will understand what stakeholders want.
Responding to change over following a plan: In software development, changes are a reality that your software process should reflect. A project plan should be flexible enough to change as the different cases demand.
Now moving on to Agile software development, the best way to explain the process is Divide and Rule. Not the British way of ruling countries, but the humane way of making the work process more efficient.
It works by breaking projects down into a little bit of user functionality, prioritising them, and then delivering them continuously in 2-4 cycles called Sprints or Iterations. In one short Sprint (2-4 weeks), a full development cycle is performed. It includes analysis, design, coding, testing, and product release.
At the end of each Sprint, developers release a working software solution, and the performance is evaluated by the customer. The lessons learned in each Sprint are captured in retrospectives and used in the next iterations.
Advantages
High-quality product
Reduces technical debt
Increased adaptability
User-focused testing
Creates total alignment and transparency
Reduced risks
Increased customer satisfaction
Improves time to market
Early and predictable delivery
Better project control
Disadvantages
Like everything, agile also has its downside. But unlike others, these can be easily mitigated.
It will be challenging to set KPIs because of the see-as-we-go nature of the program.
The documentation in this process doesn’t start from the beginning, but is mostly done just in time before the final output. Hence the resulting document will be less detailed.
The minimal planning at the beginning can easily get sidetracked but can be rectified with sufficient documentation or a clear vision of your final product."
Ryan Wilcox,Studied at Rochester Institute of Technology,2018,58,"From the perspective of a developer who’s been around the block a few times, Agile has some weaknesses.
Most of these sound like big enterprise problems, but you’d be surprised how often they creep up into even small companies.
It can make human problems more apparent (at least to developers on a team): That team that’s in pure firefighting mode all the time because their boss can’t make up their mind for more than a week - or can’t shelter team from external demands for more than a week). The director level person that manages only by looking at charts that go up-and-to-the-right. The product person that plays “blame the developer” when a feature comes out exactly as they asked but doesn’t give good user experience in the real world (“forget about iterating, we pay you all too much to do that, you should read my mind”). The micromanager that turns the 5 minute daily standup into an hour long thing.
If departments in the organization didn’t talk to each other before, making the developers work in 2 week increments won’t help. In some cases that will mean the developers will outpace the other departments… which is great, but as a developer it’s demoralizing to, 3 weeks after I thought I put a feature to bed, to start getting bug reports on it.
Large organizations try to fit the “2 week iteration” thing into departments where it just doesn’t belong. Your customer support team shouldn’t be doing 2 week iterations, they are a team that reacts to events. But large organizations really want a unified management approach sometimes…
Doing R&D in an Agile organization is hard. “Why can’t you - our one special Innvoation Platform Transformation team - give me estimates and a backlog that details how long this project will take, like the other engineering teams can, kinda?” Putting aside the problems in most of that statement, if you’re in a team that is say using tech unfamiliar to any of the team members and even the rest of the organization, well sometimes there won’t be a nice burndown chart at the end of the sprint, or 5 sprints ahead planned out with every single task. (Yes! Also “not Agile”! But that’s the cultural expectation that evolves all or most of the time!)
Sometimes deveolper problems aren’t boiled up with the respect they deserve. Product people winning the “what goes on this sprint” contest all the time, so broken things aren’t fixed. Developers knowing their organization is broken (“Standups shouldn’t be 1 hour long”) and not getting listened to. Agile implementations theoretically should adapt to what works well for the team, but too often that always means, “The developers should adjust in this way - maybe with more meetings!”. Sure, sometimes that’s fine… but also sometimes the boots on the ground have a point.
Agile is… non-obvious how to scale in the large. If you have 10 Agile teams that need to talk to each other because they are part of a massive release of software… even in 2018 we’re only _starting_ to understand how to do that. How you manage 70–100 developers, say nothing of 700–1000 developers? Only certain organizations have these problems, but this is an actual problem with Agile, not just a cultural problem with organizations running or adopting Agile.
In short: “Agile” isn’t Magic Fairy Dust you can sprinkle on your org and have its people and organizational problems disappear… (But some people think it is, because the marketing is good…)"
Emily Hilton,"Former Blockchain Enthusiast, Business Consultant",2022,78,"Hello,
Let us discuss about agile methodology and the advantages and disadvantages of agile methodology:
An agile methodology is a project management practice that promotes a collaborative, iterative and incremental approach to project management.
It is said to be agile because it estimates both your initial needs and those generated by future changes.
Agile Methodology is a process of software development (such as other software development methodologies – waterfall model, V-model, iterative model, etc.), however, the Agile development model is also a type of incremental model.
Software develops in incremental, rapid cycles. In English, Agile means ‘the ability to move quickly and easily’ and respond to change rapidly – this is an important aspect of Agile software development.
Advantages of Agile Methodology :
In Agile methodology the delivery of software is unremitting.
The customers are satisfied because after every Sprint working feature of the software is delivered to them.
Customers can have a look of the working feature which fulfilled their expectations.
If the customers has any feedback or any change in the feature then it can be accommodated in the current release of the product.
In Agile methodology the daily interactions are required between the business people and the developers.
In this methodology attention is paid to the good design of the product.
Changes in the requirements are accepted even in the later stages of the development.
An Agile/Scrum approach can improve organizational synergy by breaking down organizational barriers and developing a spirit of trust and partnership around organizational goals.
Disadvantages of the Agile Methodology :
In Agile methodology the documentation is less.
Sometimes in Agile methodology the requirement is not very clear hence it’s difficult to predict the expected result.
In few of the projects at the starting of the software development life cycle it’s difficult to estimate the actual effort required.
Because of the ever-evolving features, there is always a risk of the ever-lasting project.
For complex projects, the resource requirement and effort are difficult to estimate.

Szabi Kisded,"Founder, WordPress Plugin Developer & Blogger at CodeRevolution (2018–present)",2019,1,"The Agile Method is a particular approach to project management that is utilized in software development. This method assists teams in responding to the unpredictability of constructing software. It uses incremental, iterative work sequences that are commonly known as sprints.
Advantages of Agile Methods are:
1. light weight
2. They are people based rather than plan based
3. It promotes interactions between individuals over processes and tools
4. Developers working software rather than comprehensive documentation
5. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
6. Responding to change over following a plan"
Justin Jackson,founder of MegaMaker,2014,8,"Agile actually defines a group of methodologies that share a similar philosophy (originally defined in the 2001 Manifesto for Agile Software Development).
A core tenet of agile development is to work in short iterations, or sprints. After each sprint, the team should have produced a small new iteration (incremental release). At this point the team can also re-evaluate it's current direction, and make changes if needed.
Other characteristics common to most agile methodologies:

Specs (or requirements) are written simply, often in the format of a user story on a card:
(this screenshot is from Sprint.ly)
Participation of stakeholder (or product owner) in the process
Finish work on one feature before moving on to the next
Lots of team collaboration and cooperation, and strong sense of ownership
Testing is done throughout the process
Types of agile methodologies
Scrum - one of the best known agile methodologies. Illustrated Scrum reference PDF
Lean - adopts lean manufacturing principles for software development. Lean Software Development
Kanban - there are 3 core characteristics: visualize your workflow, limit work-in-progress, prioritize backlog. People following Kanban, will often use a Kanban board that looks like this:
(Blank Kanban board with 3 columns: Backlog, Current, Complete. [Source])
Extreme Programming (XP) - controversial agile practice. Agile Software Development: What is extreme programming?"
Ashwin Chandrasekaran,"Scrum practitioner, PMI-ACP, Blogs at http://breatheagile.net",2017,1,"Agile shifts the focus of project management from cost and schedule to delivering value to customer.
How is it done?
Customer Collaboration - All Agile methods encourage customer involvement in all stages of a project. This makes frequent reviews and feedback cycles possible
Incremental Delivery - By developing and delivering features in short cycles, the customer can see the evolution of the final product. This makes course corrections possible in a regular fashion rather than at the end of a project
Continuous Improvement - Using various practices like Retrospective meetings, Agile enables the team to look back frequently and adjust the process as needed
Team Ownership - Agile encourages the team to own their plan, design and commitment to delivery. The responsibility of meeting the project goals shifts from project manager to developers
Quality Focus - Short iterations don’t mean the absence of testing. Agile methods enforce every increment to be well tested
Unambiguous Requirements - Using techniques like User Stories and Epics/Themes, Agile makes the creation and understanding of requirements much easier than traditional BRMs
In short, Agile is a different and more pragmatic way to approach project management."
Noah Jonas,Technical Content Creator & Researcher,2023,78,"In the modern digitalized world, the majority of software development companies follow agile methodology for achieving a more seamless and efficient development process. The agile software development methodology is different from the waterfall as it puts focus on developing software in an incremental and rapid cycle. Thus, for a project which involves repetitive in-between feature additions by the client, this particular methodology can ensure enough flexibility to complete it and deliver it within the specified deadline.
Advantages of opting for agile development methodology:
Increase internal interactions between testers, developers, and business people.
Shifts in the client's needs can still be taken into consideration even at the later stage of development.
The delivery of software is continuous under the Agile methodology.
Good product design is the top priority.
Flaws of agile software development methodology:
The resource requirements and effort required for complicated projects are difficult to estimate.
It is impossible to estimate the actual work required in a few projects at the beginning of the software development life cycle.
Challenge to predict the final outcome as the requirement keeps changing over time.

Vikash Kodati,"10+ years of exp using Agile methodology. Helped Ameriprise, UHC be successful",2015,3,"That is a broad question. I am sure you will find the specifics online but I ll help you understand the broader stroke. Its a structure that helps realize incremental business value quickly (allowing course corrections) and also lets each role consume the information it needs. The process itself is very flexible and leaves a lot of space of interpretation because of which there are more ""Agile-buts"" (look it up) than pure Agile teams. The important part is for all the team (Developers, BAs, Scrum Master, Business teams, Product Manager) to agree upon a common ground rather than trying to following something that is carved in stone.
We follow a rule that an agile team (developers mainly) should not be larger than what 2 large pizzas can feed :)."
Robert Merrill,Agile project estimator and agile adoption coach since 2004,2016,1,"Agile and its various flavors have been thoroughly defined, so I have nothing to add there.
I think agile's decisive advantage is that it is much more forgiving of estimation errors. When we commit to projects, we do so with the belief that:
The results will be worth more than they cost, and
Cost (nearly always) and time (often) won't exceed constraints.
The go/no decision rests on estimates of cost, duration, and value. These estimates have large (2x-4x or more) ranges, and additional up-front work often doesn't reduce these ranges very much.
By putting the estimation uncertainty in the scope of what will be delivered, and maximizing the value of that as we go, agile eliminates nearly all estimation-related risk."
The Next Tech,Works at The Next Tech (2018–present),2023,54,"In API tests, developers use load testing to understand how an API performs with the increased number of calls. This test helps the development team to agree on whether the product can meet certain real-life expectations under a high load.
You can call it “Security Test 2.0” because this process is the next level of security testing. In this type, the testers analyze different attacks on API from an outsider’s point of view. This helps them to design better security for the product.
Security Testing gives the Dev team an overview of how the API will perform against cyberattacks. The process tests an API’s encryption methods and checks how it behaves with permissions and access controls.
The general idea of UI testing is to check whether the API or other integral parts’ user interface is running correctly. In terms of the codebase, UI testing is not a significant part of API testing. However, this process helps measure the health and efficiency of the app’s front-end and back-end."
John Lee,Lived in The United States of America,2020,3,"5 Key Disadvantages of Agile Methodology
Poor resource planning
Limited documentation
Fragmented output
No finite end
Difficult measurement"
Jaimi McEntire,Author has 4.4K answers and 7.6M answer views,2018,2,"The major benefits are that it makes your development more predictable, and there are always work items available, and work items have been recently discussed, so there is less misunderstanding, and constant review to make sure that the development effort matches the business needs.
The major disadvantages are that a sprint is uneven. The load is not balanced. At the beginning of a sprint, the QA team does not have enough work, at the end of the sprint, the development team is winding down, and the QA team has too much work. There are of course ways to address this - the development crew tests at the end, and the (canonical) suggestion is for QA to work on “test scripts” at the beginning. But these have their own issues. Because a team has to bid to complete items, and the sprint is seen as unsuccessful if they do not complete the items, there is a tendency to underbid and sandbag (letting the work fill the time), leading to a decrease in productivity. Even though this is an effort to give developers more say in what and how they work, the constant review and discussion gives some developers the feeling that they are being micro-managed.
We’re an agile team, and we’ve addressed all these issues in various ways, and overall we’re more productive than we were before the switch to agile."
Aadarsh Patel,"Lives in Pune, Maharashtra, India (2008–present)",2023,54,"Advantages of Agile Project Management
You can deploy software quicker, so your customer can get value sooner rather than later
You waste fewer resources because you always work on up-to-date tasks
You can better adapt to change and respond faster
Faster turnaround times
You can detect and fix issues and defects faster
You spend less time on bureaucracy and busywork
There's a big community of Agile practitioners with whom you can share knowledge
You can get immediate feedback (which also improves team morale)
Developers can improve their skills based on QA feedback
You don't have to worry about premature optimization
You can experiment and test ideas because its costs are low
Disadvantages of Agile Project Management
Agile has substantial advantages, and it's important to know the disadvantages, limitations, and risks it brings.
Documentation tends to get sidetracked, which makes it harder for new members to get up to speed
It's more difficult to measure progress than it is in Waterfall because progress happens across several cycles
Agile demands more time and energy from everyone because developers and customers must constantly interact with each other
When developers run out of work, they can't work on a different project since they'll be needed soon
Projects can become ever-lasting because there's no clear end
Scope creep and experience rot
Clients who work on a specified budget or schedule can't know how much the project will actually cost, which makes for a very complicated sales cycle (""Until iteration ends,"" is not something clients like to hear)
The product lacks overall design, both from a UX and architecture point of view, which leads to problems the more you work on the product
Teams can get sidetracked into delivering new functionalities at the expense of technical debt, which increases the amount of unplanned work
Features that are too big to fit into one or even several cycles are avoided because they don't fit in nicely into the philosophy
You need a long-term vision for the product and actively work on communicating it
Products lack cohesion, and the user journey is fragmented because the design is fragmented. The more time passes, the more disjointed the software ends up becoming
Short cycles don't leave enough time for the design thinking process, so designers have to redevelop the experience over and over due to negative feedback

Maya Misra,Digital Marketer,2021,2,"Here Are Some Pros & Cons of agile methodology :
Pros:
Continuous Improvement
It gets challenging to stick to your plans considering ever-changing client’s requirements and moods. Agile methodology empowers your clients to keep their views amid project development, and you to improvise according to their current state of mind.
2. Client satisfaction
The model allows you to arrange open communication with your clients. With video conferences or calls you can understand minor project requirements and raise tokens should there be any problems. Apart from strengthening relationships, the system gratifies your clients making them feel valued for their opinions. The early working prototype satisfies your customers.
3. Reduced Risks
The changing trends and fickleness of client’s requirements often cost developing companies more than they anticipate. Imagine being at the fourth stage of a cycle, and your client refuses to accept the design. How much would the deconstruction and starting from scratch cost? But the agile model reduces all the risks as you’re keeping them posted at each sprint.
4. Adaptive approach
Need to change a module? The session-based skimming allows your team to travel extra-mile to have the most optimized functionality. The self-organized and motivated teams in the agile web development model help easy adaptation and customization without flattening your wallet.
5. No strict structure
With no strict structure or project scope, the project remains flexible throughout the development phase. You can scale or descale the project too.
cons:
Not useful for small projects
Agile projects have overhead costs in terms of meetings, reviews and retrospectives, daily stand-ups, client interaction, and a lot more. You might not want to go for it for small projects— the projects that won’t ring much of your cash register.
2. Takes more time
With the waterfall model— the probability of changes is 0.5 by the end of the project, i.e., your client may either nod a yes or say a no! But with continuous client engagement and reviewing in the agile web development model— you might have to have regular changes every sprint. Plus iterative meetings and reviewings can consume a lot of time.
3. Needs an expert to take major decisions
The agile approach is not possible without the decisions of the expert in the company. It needs a managing force to arrange meetings, dividing sprints, reviewing work, and interacting with clients. The process may not move if the concerned person goes missing for a few days.
Thank You!!"
Nabarun Mondal,Engineering Leader with 20 years of Experience,2021,26,"Agile is NOT a methodology. It is a mindset.
Team must deliver faster, simpler, workable code.
The only success criterion of agile is how much time saving it had.
If using other mindset it used to be delivered in X hours,
and Agile can do it in 0.1X hours, agile mindset has own.
Anywhere it is not possible to do, agile is at disadvantage. That includes every possible “serious” Engineering domain.
Agile will not work, does not work anywhere serious Engineering is required - build engine of SpaceX rocket.
If someone is actually developing a kernel - even then I do not think Agile works."
Agilemania,Agilemania is to be the Preferred Agile Company and partner.,2023,54,"As with other software development approaches (such as the waterfall model, the V-model, the iterative model, etc.), the Agile development model is a methodology for creating software, in addition to being a form of agile method. Software is created in quick, incremental cycles. Agile is an important component of Agile software development and signifies ""the capacity to move swiftly and effortlessly"" and adapt to change quickly in English.
Advantages of Agile Methodology :
In Agile methodology the delivery of software is unremitting.
The customers are satisfied because after every Sprint working feature of the software is delivered to them.
Customers can have a look of the working feature which fulfilled their expectations.
If the customers has any feedback or any change in the feature then it can be accommodated in the current release of the product.
In Agile methodology the daily interactions are required between the business people and the developers.
Disadvantages of the Agile Methodology :
In Agile methodology the documentation is less.
Sometimes in Agile methodology the requirement is not very clear hence it’s difficult to predict the expected result.
In few of the projects at the starting of the software development life cycle it’s difficult to estimate the actual effort required."
Mike Fontner,IT-Security Engineer / Application Security (2020–present),2020,1,"One of the disadvantages - that most people are not aware of in the beginning - is that it puts all responsibility much further down in the “food-chain”.
The rule most prevalent I found so far is this one: “You build it, you run it!”
Seems to be simple and logical at the first glance. True it IS simple and logical.
AND it has a TON of implications most managers, expecially in the upper management are absolutely not aware of.
For example: If I’m the one running it, then I also want to know what happens while the system is under production. I also want / need to know how the system is fairing under test. I also … ! You get the drift.
In agile, High Quality DevSecOps is imperative to do your job successfully! No manager can tell you exactly what to do when and how, because they don’t know what you solved how and where.
The whole responsibility is on the team. Therefore the team has to decide what works best … for the teams responsibilities.
In a working agile environment (emphasis is on working!) the role of a manager is not to tell people what to do but to make sure that the team can do what it has to do in order to fullfill it’s responsibilities! That also means to clear obstacles in whatever form they appear, make sure different departments work smoothly together, make sure the proper talent is represented in the team, coaching your people to get the proper education they need if necessary, etc. pp.
The pressure, the responsibility and also the lack of someone else to blame is not for everyone though. You need properly geared people as well who apprechiate such an environment, because nobody will tell you what to do when and how. That’s YOUR (!!) repsonsibility too.
And that’s just one aspect.
A switch to agile is so deep and brings such profound changes in the whole culture, that old silos and management structures within the whole company will either be destroyed in the process or the agile will fail. Because you cannot have only a small agile thingie somewhere in the company while the rest goes “unspoiled”.
It’s an all or nothing decision.
Yes, IF agile is truly implemented, you can reap a LOT of benefits!
BUT on the road to fully get a grip, figure out what works for you and what not, million things can go wrong and nothing will be achieved. Then agility is blamed. It’s not the system though. It’s the change, that people resisted."
Chuck Cobb,Agile Project Mgt Author and Instructor (Over 200K Students),2018,4,"First, to be technically correct, Agile is not a methodology; it is a mindset and a philosophy defined by the Agile Manifesto. Scrum might be considered a methodology although many people would argue that Scrum is a framework, not a methodology.
Many traditional methodologies are well-defined and prescriptive - that’s called a “defined process control model”
Agile methodologies (or frameworks, if you prefer) are meant to be flexible and adaptive - that’s called an “empirical process control model”
From that broad perspective, here are the pro’s and con’s:
Pro - Agile methodologies are better suited for situations with higher levels of uncertainty because they allow taking a flexible and incremental approach to resolve uncertainty as a project is in progress
Con - Agile methodologies are less predictable in determining the cost and schedule for completing a project prior to the start of the project
Pro - Agile methodologies emphasize creativity and innovation to maximize the business value of the solution
Con - Too much emphasis on creativity and innovation can lead to significant changes in scope
Of course, you should realize that this is not a binary and mutually-exclusive choice between “Agile” and “Waterfall” as many people seem to think. It’s a matter of fitting the methodology to the nature of the problem rather than force-fitting a project to one of those extremes. Sometimes that requires blending Agile and traditional plan-driven project management in the right proportions to fit the situation."
Sachin Chauhan,Engineer in making,2021,1,"Agile is B.S.
It's has no advantage, doing work in iterations is a sign of the incompetency of developer and more over the unclear goal of the client.
To avoid these two issues, they have created very cleverly this so called Agile methodology, which if you look closely you will find that it complicates things and kills innovation.
This is just non-sense created by some MBA grads.
This method helps everyone except the people who actually do the damn job.
Purely managerial oriented process.
It is a poor attempt to make demeaning and scut work interesting.
In simple terms, suppose you order a burger at McDonald's. Now, instead of waiting for it patiently outside, you go into the kitchen and follow the process till a bigger is finally made. Just imagine, the ruckus you are gonna create in the kitchen.
Now, you are the client and kitchen workers are the developers. The person at the counter is the manager just facilitating the client to have his way."
JOY OF PERFORMING,Helping organizations achieve more,2023,1,"Running a tech team is not easy. When you are new, you cannot just decide to adopt the agile methodology. You must understand your business priorities and critical goals. You have to prepare your team and the customers for this.
Implementing agile practices takes time. Being agile does not mean doing everything fast. It's about doing the right things at the right time more accurately. People have to settle in and allow room for growth as they go.
Pros & Cons of working with agile methodology
Don't think there is a fixed plan for agile practices. It depends on other factors like your team size, projects, clients, resources, etc.
Below are some commonly seen pros and cons of using the agile framework.
Pros
Immediate feedback on the product - Users directly give feedback to the development team.
Elimination of silos - Team members collaborate actively.
Can help you get highly competitive - Software industry is aggressive. It is helpful to have efficient product improvements.
Team gets more autonomy - Agile group gets to take risks and experiment.
Working software versions are tested - Team tests real software with users, not some plan.
Efficient collaboration
Transparency in product enhancement - Users can see the past product roadmap and each improvement.
Lean and productive product development - Cost-cutting and efficient production.
Cons
Lack of purpose - The tasks may be pretty clear, but the overall purpose behind the work may not be communicated and understood.
Can get less holistic - People can get too involved in the processes that they may forget critical priorities or company values.
Easy to misinterpret the methodology - Teams can mistake agile for faster deliveries rather than focusing on quality.
Project management can get messy - If not managed well.
Professionals may get less time to grow - People may get busy and not take time to reflect and analyze their performance.
Can go off-track from critical business goals - Focusing too much on agility may lead people to derail from main goals.
It's always good to work more efficiently, but it all must move your business forward. Be clear about your priorities.

Documentation is not a deliverable of Agile
A trust relationship must exist between members of the team
Sometimes in Agile methodology the requirement is not very clear hence it’s difficult to predict the expected result.
In few of the projects at the starting of the software development life cycle it’s difficult to estimate the actual effort required.
If you're looking for a better career I personally suggest to go for agile tester certification
If you are wondering where to begin this journey? Then you should check the certificate in agile tester certification
As I have one reference for a Agile Tester Foundation Certification I found one course on google they provide certificates
The certification cost is also affordable here.
Many of the reputed company employees have done this courses from here and give good responses and rated this certificate as the best
To get this certification you have to pass the GSDC Institution certifications.
GSDC's certification is aimed towards sharing a deep understanding of all the advanced l and d certification
The purpose of agile tester certification qualification is to confirm that a candidate has sufficient knowledge and understanding of the benefits of this certification."
Rajeev Techexpert,Author has 77 answers and 81K answer views,2020,1,"Hi,

First of all lets understand what is agile model?

Agile model is a type of project management process which is mainly used for software development. Where demands and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of cross-functional teams and customers.

Advantage of Agile model:
- Developers, testers and customer can interact with each other.
- Software is delivered frequently.
- Continuous monitoring to technical excellence and good design.
- Daily coordination and cooperation between business people and developers.
- Adaptation to changing circumstances.
- Even last minute changes in requirements are welcomed.
Disadvantage of Agile model:
- Agile model is not useful for small development projects.
- Project can easily get taken off track if the customer is not clear about final outcome.
- Documentation of the project is less detailed because of the nature of agile.
- Agile Model require more time and commitment as customers, developers and testers must constantly interact with each other.
Above answer is based on my experience in a software app testing company. I hope this will help.
Do let me know in case of any query regarding the same.
Thanks,
Rajeev"

Henry Robinson,Crypto/DeFi/Web3 Enthusiast,2013,50,"I'm no expert, but I have gone from being an Agile ignoramus to living and breathing the stuff in a very short period of time. I wish someone had written something out like this for me when I started.
The lowdown. In layman's terms.
SCRUM Methodology Principles:
First things first, SCRUM is just one of several agile methodologies.
Release Often
Release small bits of code when they are ready (or on a regular short cadence like 2 weeks or monthly vs. every year).
Think of how a new Windows comes out every 2 years vs. how you get an update of apps on your phone like freaking constantly. The constant updates are coming from companies who use agile. (note, Microsoft or whoever may use agile, and release like waterfall. I understand the difference, but layman's terms remember)
The opposite of agile is waterfall. Waterfall is where you build a bunch of code and wait to release it all at once. Windows 7, Windows 8 etc. vs. nobody has any clue what ""version"" Facebook is on because they update it constantly.
The point of doing it this way is so that you can get constant business and customer feedback and incorporate it into the product as quickly as possible.
Efficient Project Teams:
Project teams usually consist of a small group of engineers, a product manager and a product owner (usually the business owner). They meet regularly for short periods of time and are constantly in communication about the status of the project.
Business, product, engineering should be co-located if possible. The meeting cadence and rules depend on which agile methodology you are using. A lot of it is bullshit, but some things are cool like 15 minute standup meetings. In a 15 minute standup, everyone gets together in the hall or by the water cooler or whatever,and tells everybody else what they are going to accomplish that day. This is where you can ask for help or collaboration from co-workers etc.
Dividing Major Projects into Tiny Tiny bits:
This has to do with the size of features. So for example, if you notice how startup websites come together, they usually have a fully functional, but simplified version of the product first, and then they add tiny features as time goes forward. This is done so that the product team can get constant customer feedback. This is in contrast to waterfall, where the product team goes into hiding for a long period of time, but what they emerge with might not meet the market or customer need anymore.
Milestones and Sprints:
This just describes way project timelines are divided. So milestones are a set period of time, usually 2 weeks and sprints are just tackling a single problem during that 2 week period. There can be multiple sprints in a milestone.
The impetus behind sprints and milestones is that for each sprint, some piece of the final product should be complete. At a milestone, the code should be ready to be shipped.
Regular Product Demos
At the end of each milestone, there needs to be a demo of shippable code. Something that has few bugs and meets the customer need.
Customer and Market Focus
I probably should have listed this first. The whole point of agile is to get constant user and business feedback while the product is being built. This also allows you to experiment more. That way, if you mess something up in the product, the next release is not to far away to fix it. Think Facebook and privacy settings.
Product Backlog:
In Agile, you are supposed to ship product on a regular cadence. All features are added to a product backlog, divided into small projects that fit within a sprint, and then prioritized. The backlog is just a way to keep track of all of the ideas people have, requests from customers, major bugs and other things. It's just a prioritized to do list that is constantly updated by the team. It's designed to keep the user first and make sure everyone is aligned on what to work on next.
The point is to be customer focused, get constant feedback and to ship frequently so you can test and iterate.
There are a whole host of details that I have left out here, but I believe this is enough to know for a marketing person. Feel free to correct any glaring errors. I would love to learn what I don't know."
Jonathan Bush,"23 years PM, including PMI PMP , moved into Scrum & Kanban",2023,0,"Agile is great for software development, where functionality is being added to a base. The order is unimportant, allowing the sequence to suit business importance.
Agile is useless for infrastructure projects, because the sequence is critical. You can't install a server without first acquiring it, which first needs planning and designing, approval for the spend, etc. Various parts have to come together ,which means scheduling is critical."
Aditya Pratap Bhuyan (ଆଦିତ୍ଯ ପ୍ରତାପ ଭୁୟାଁ),Former Consultant at Dell EMC India (2018–2024),2023,1,"There are many advantages of Agile methodology for project management. Agile methods can help teams manage work more efficiently and do the work more effectively while delivering the highest quality product within the constraints of the budget.
While Agile teams work well as a unit and can react better to the inevitable changes that come with most projects, there is one facet of project management that Agile teams often overlook: Visual management.
The Benefits of Agile Development
With visual management, Agile teams can enhance their ability to work effectively by presenting the data in a visual way rather than in list-form on a spreadsheet or in a wiki. This way, it is easier to comprehend project details and to manage change.
Major benefits of visual project management for Agile include:
Visibility of project details
Increased team efficiency
Ability to adapt to changes
Ability to scale
Let’s take a closer look at some key characteristics of an Agile team and explore how visual management can help.
Agile Characteristics
Agile is a method for getting the work done that really matters. For example, instead of spending hours or days building out a detailed project plan that may or may not match the project’s execution, an Agile team would begin with a small portion of work, assess progress, then continue down the path once enough feedback has been gathered to indicate they are on the right path.
Principles of how to work as an Agile team are laid out in the Agile Manifesto, a set of guidelines that were developed by software developers to establish expectations around how to operate. These principles place:
People before processes and tools
Working software over documentation
Collaboration over negotiation
Change management over project planning
One of the primary areas of focus for Agile teams is the ability to work iteratively. Iterative work is completed in short cycles with a small portion of the overall project done at one time.
The main benefit of iterative work is that less work gets wasted. That is, when something changes about the project, the amount of re-work that must be done is minimized. In other words, teams don’t have to go too far down one path, only to find out they must backtrack and start all over again.
The theme of iterative work extends beyond the project level and can be applied by breaking down any amount of work into manageable tidbits that can be clearly represented visually.
One rule of thumb when practicing visual management with iterative work is that all work should be broken down as much as possible, so the team can see the work, prioritize the most important items, and divide and conquer.
It is not uncommon for software development projects to take months or even years to complete. During a project’s timeline, changes can occur either in technology or with the business requirements.
Changes to the business requirements of a project usually mean the project will take more time, and more time means more cost. Because change is the only constant when it comes to project management, incremental work methods like Agile are necessary to help control a project’s final cost. And in the software world, costs can skyrocket quickly and are often a primary driver of a company’s decision on whether to move forward with a project.
Team efficiency
Agile teams are known to be highly efficient at getting work done. Because Agile teams share a collaborative culture, efficiencies tend to have a ripple effect.
Look for an Agile solutions provides insights into delivery trends to remove bottlenecks and adapt workflow processes for improved productivity.
When everyone agrees on what the most important work is, and when each person can focus on the most important work, the entire team moves forward in unison, falling into steady cycles of work production and product releases, which contributes to the predictability of Agile projects.
As you can see by the relationships between efficiency, collaboration and predictability, the characteristics of an Agile team are interconnected so that one characteristic feeds into the next, forming a holistic set of habits that can be described as Agile.
Adaptability of a software development team
Project managers cannot see into the future, but they can impact how easily a team is able to adapt to changes when they occur. The ability to adapt to change is a cornerstone of Agile project management and is one of the key advantages of Agile methodology.
When teams put their time to good use, they can deliver what the stakeholder wants without overspending. This not only makes stakeholders happy, it makes project teams happy to know they have used their skills to deliver a quality product.
Scalability of Agile projects
Time and cost are the main factors in determining whether a company will go forward with a project.
How long will the project take?
What will it cost?
Will it be worth the initial investment to get this project done?
What else could be done with the same resources and team members that may hold more value?
The last question is the most important one related to this article, because it touches on a key point: The larger the company, the greater the need for an Agile project management system.
How best to utilize people and resources is a question that comes up constantly, especially for companies that cannot predict the frequency of projects yet to come. As companies continue to struggle with having too much work and not enough people to do it, new ways of scaling projects have emerged.
Driving agility across teams requires a consolidated view of work priority and project status, whether in the same room or distributed across the globe.
Productivity analyses can help teams understand how the same amount of people can work smarter and produce more without investing in additional resources. Conversely, companies must take care not to commit too many resources to a project only to find the value does not justify the costs associated with getting it done.
Instead of evaluating whether their team members are focusing on the work that holds the most value, some companies skirt the issue by requiring team members to work longer hours. While this may be a short-term solution for a sudden, one-time increase in workload, overworking team members can quickly take a toll, resulting in lowered team morale and decreased productivity.
A key advantage of Agile methodology is that it is a scalable project management tool.
Not only can the principles of Agile be applied across multiple functions within a project team, they can also be applied to multiple project teams and leveraged by project management offices (PMOs) to analyze productivity and identify areas of improvement.
Using Agile project management helps companies pool resources and assign the right people to the right projects according to need or priority.
Predictability for Agile project managers
Companies measure the value of a project in terms of cost and returns. If the returns from a project outweigh the cost, then a company may decide to go forward with that project. But if the cost of a project is unknown, as it is with many projects these days, predicting the outcome of that project in terms of success becomes almost impossible.
For this reason, predictability in projects is important. One advantage of Agile methodology is that when companies take the time on the front end to plan a project using Agile techniques, they can estimate the cost of a project to determine whether they should continue.
There is no single characteristic of Agile that makes it work so well to manage projects. Instead, it is the holistic practice of Agile that makes development teams successful. When project teams choose to practice Agile, they are practicing a concept that is still evolving, making this one of the best ways to work in a culture of continuous improvement.

It is tough to keep the whole team equally dedicated towards the project.
You can handle the project but handling people is always a challenge.
People run behind agile user stories or other deliverable without even understanding them.
Developers and QA have different interpretation of user stories.
We always tend to squeeze things in a sprint but sometimes that effects the quality as well. And if we try to maintain the quality, this compromises the sprint time stamp.
Agile success requires experienced and dedicated team.
Agile is not a one day task or one time exercise, you ace it with the experience and challenges you face.
Removing roadblocks at right time sounds like a miracle only. We always get to know about roadblocks during the sprint not at the very start."
Harsh Gupta,Make $$$ listening to b2b sales pitches on fozzie.io,2021,16,"Agile is an approach to software development that seeks the continuous delivery of working software created in rapid iterations. Agile Software Development uses adaptive approaches and teamwork to focus on continuous improvement. Agile software development methodologies are all about delivering small pieces of working software quickly to improve customer satisfaction.The underlying values for agile projects are: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a plan
Agile methods stress working with users throughout the development process, continuing even after deploying a product or system (also called as incremental deployment). They promote evolutionary versus revolutionary changes, which can lead to more improvements in quality and customer satisfaction due to fewer surprises when it comes time for release. Agiles work best in dynamic environments such as construction where new requirements arise from user interaction during the course of the project.
Adaptive development methods seek to deliver business value early, which are the most likely to have a positive return on investment. Adaptive methodologies guide people and groups in iterative cycles to improve products, services, or the process that delivers them. The goal is to refine requirements and scope, adding solutions as appropriate according to what has been learned over time. Agile projects try to minimize waste caused by bad processes or poorly articulated goals at the expense of perfection in detail. Agile models can be applied successfully across different scales of product delivery – from small teams involved with quick design-build-test iterations used for prototyping new ideas through very large multi-disciplinary agile teams that work collaboratively during all phases of an enterprise's IT portfolio from product concept to realization.
Agile projects are more likely to succeed since they deliver working solutions quickly. In contrast, traditional approaches are more likely to fail due to the time and money wasted on projects that need significant reworking or that never produce a product in users' hands. The leading agile methods include Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum, Lean Software Development, Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) and Crystal Methods™ (CMM).
A key advantage of agile over waterfall is its ability to handle change gracefully without having project plans collapse under new requirements. Agile methodologies use adaptive approaches and teamwork to focus on continuous improvement. Agile's flexible approach enables team members to work together with customers during all phases of development, which encourages clients' input as new design solutions are built.
Agile projects involve multiple software developers and other project team members working together in small teams to quickly deliver new functionality, features or products. It could also refer to the skills that a business requires of its employees [to become agile]. Agile thus contrasts with traditional command-and-control forms of organization (that may be called ""waterfall""). A common shorthand used by many agile proponents is that the high cost of change is one of the central challenges faced by organizations executing a traditional approach to IT development, whereas organizations adopting an agile strategy embrace change as a constant factor impacting project success."
Aadarsh Patel,"Lives in Pune, Maharashtra, India (2008–present)",2023,1,"Agile Methodology is a people-focused, results-focused approach to software development that respects our rapidly changing world. It’s centered around adaptive planning, self-organization, and short delivery times. It’s flexible, fast, and aims for continuous improvements in quality, using tools like Scrum and eXtreme Programming.
Characteristics of the Agile Development Method
1. Modular Functioning
Modularity is considered one of the key elements of a good process. Modularity is the element that allows the components to break down and that broken component is called activities. The software development process is just the set of activities that frames or transforms the vision of the software system into reality. Agile Software development process makes use of good tools and is wielded with good software craftsman who is well known to apply those at the right place and right time. These can not be utilized for the production line for manufacturing software products.
2. Iteration
The agile software development process acknowledges the working on attempting wrong before its correct. So, for this reason, agile processes focus on small cycles. Each cycle has a task of defined activities and those activities must be completed in a correct manner, these cycles have a time slot of a week, from starting to completing the activities. The iteration i.e single cycle may or may not get a 100 % correct element. Because of this reason one short cycle is repeated several times until the correct result is achieved.
3. Time-Bound
Software development comes with time limits or the development team must give a delivery date to the customer, to keep things under track the iterations play a good role as it keeps time limit between one and six weeks on each iteration and it can be scheduled accordingly. There are higher chances that it may not schedule all activities in a single iteration, else wise only those activities will be attempted which are necessary to achieve the goals which were set at the beginning of the iteration. Rescheduling or functionality reduction can be done to deliver the project on time, on the allotted time.
4. Parsimony
Agile software development is considered an upgraded version of the traditional approach with time constrains add on. Impossible deadlines are not attempted for rapid delivery, each phase of development is kept in mind as this attempt may take away the quality from the product and that’s a big NO. Instead, agile approach focus on parsimony keeps the activities to minimal and only necessary to mitigate risks and achieve their goal.
5. Adaptation
During the development or during iterations there are higher chances of unknown risks they may be exposed; the agile approach is prepared to deal with these unknown risks. If there are changes in different results during the functionality, new activities or functionality can be added to reach the goal.
6. Incremental
Agile system is not built entirely at once, the system is partitioned and look out for increments that can be parallelly developed, at a different time and a different rate. Each increment is tested independently and if found ok then all are integrated into the one system for the result.
7. Convergence
It means that the risks are attacked actively because it is worth to know the risks. This takes the system closer to the results. Risks solving during each iteration is one of the great processes that leads to a successful iteration.
8. People-Oriented
The agile process is known for its priority towards customers over process and technology. The involvement of the customer is done organically. The developers evolve through adaptation and are empowered to raise their productivity and performance. These developers are very aware of dealing with the changes in the system at every stage.
9. Collaboration
The agile process has a very practical approach for discussions that is face-to-face discussion whether it is with the customer or with the team members itself. Good communications play an important role in the success of the project in the software development field. The risk of miscommunication is higher when the system is developed into pieces, it is a must for every member to understand how pieces fit together for creating a final product. The process is more into integration than to communication when individual iterations are completed. Integrating the smaller integrations into larger part developed parallelly requires collaboration with the teams to fix it correctly into the system to get the final product."
Dhruv Parmar,Lives in Paris,2023,2,"Agile development model is also a type of Incremental model. Software is developed in incremental, rapid cycles. This results in small incremental releases with each release building on previous functionality. Each release is thoroughly tested to ensure software quality is maintained. It is used for time critical applications.
Extreme Programming (XP) is currently one of the most well known agile development life cycle model.
Diagram of Agile model:
Advantages of Agile model:
Customer satisfaction by rapid, continuous delivery of useful software.
People and interactions are emphasized rather than process and tools. Customers, developers and testers constantly interact with each other.
Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months).
Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication.
Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
Regular adaptation to changing circumstances.
Even late changes in requirements are welcomed.
Disadvantages of Agile model:
In case of some software deliverables, especially the large ones, it is difficult to assess the effort required at the beginning of the software development life cycle.
There is lack of emphasis on necessary designing and documentation.
The project can easily get taken off track if the customer representative is not clear what final outcome that they want.
Only senior programmers are capable of taking the kind of decisions required during the development process. Hence it has no place for newbie programmers, unless combined with experienced resources."

Maria Matarelli,Founder & President at Formula Ink,2017,14,"Want To Do Twice The Work In Half The Time? You Need To Know This Framework
Put simply, Agile is an approach that helps people work more effectively. Just like it sounds, Agile is a nimble, flexible, and adaptable way to work. Companies use this approach to better manage work and get to market faster. It’s a methodology based on the Agile Manifesto values and principles (Manifesto for Agile Software Development). Most of us are familiar with the trials and tribulations of project management. Whether a startup or Fortune 500 company, projects often take longer and cost more than expected. That’s where Agile comes in.
Agile improves the speed, transparency, and adaptability of a company’s process by breaking big projects into smaller pieces that are more suitable for release or testing. This can be applied to software development, product development, manufacturing, just about any industry, even marketing. Think of it as “micro-testing” smaller elements of a product being developed, with improved efficiency being the driving goal as you prioritize and deliver small segments of each project.

So for example, if a company needs to launch a new website but can’t wait months for it to be finished, an Agile approach would be to put up a homepage with a nice photo, the company name, mission statement, and phone number. This would be a Minimal Viable Product (MVP). Then, each week, add a page that describes their services, then a page that shows their portfolio of work or customer testimonials, and continuing to add more pages until it’s finished. Break the project into small, manageable tasks and get going. For each website page that is finished, we can make that page go live before the rest of the site is finished. That’s an Agile approach. Many companies see great results in getting to market faster using an Agile approach, often with the Scrum Framework.
So, where does the term Scrum come from? In rugby, Scrum is a method of bringing the ball back in play after a pause in the game. The two teams are huddled together around the ball, all pushing up against each other to see who can gain possession of it—and they have to pass the ball backward in order to then move forward and score. It's a very collaborative approach. So, in Agile, we need everyone on the team working together toward a common goal. And we work in time boxes (either a week or two where we plan to complete something) then iterate upon our product as we release incrementally.
There are many types of Agile approaches including Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), and others. According to a survey done by an Agile software tool company called Version One (11th Annual State of Agile™ Report | What's the State of Agile Today?), Scrum is the most commonly used Agile framework. They do a “State of Agile” survey every year, and recently found that about 58% of companies that use Agile actually use the Scrum approach, while more than 80% use Scrum or a hybrid of Scrum.
Whenever I get too technical about the framework when talking to people, I watch their eyes begin to glaze over. But as soon as I say, “Listen, this will help you do twice the work, but in half the time,” everybody’s response is “I need that. I need that in my life.”
Don’t we all?
This is the simplified message that Jeff Sutherland, one of the creators of Scrum, loves to drive home. He says “Scrum helps you do twice the work in half the time.” However, when done properly, the output is much greater than just double, it really is exponential.
By working in short iterations, informed decisions and improved results in less time means way more bang for your buck.
But here’s the thing: Agile can actually be applied to a whole range of industries, not just marketing or project management. In fact, the same approach can even be applied to your life, your personal habits, and your everyday goals.
How I got interested in Agile says a lot about the impact the process can have on both a business and any individual person.
I have never been the type of person to sit in an office all day, working 9 to 5 and finding fulfillment from just that. That concept of corporate slavery (for lack of a better term) was never the future I imagined for myself. I’ve always believed there is more to life than repeating the same, seemingly meaningless cycles day in and day out.

When I was 22 years old, fresh out of college, I was working in project management already leading $5 million projects at State Farm, while simultaneously managing people twice my age to ensure milestones weren’t being missed.
Now, was this my “be-all-end-all?” Not particularly. But I was fascinated by what I was learning, and I saw the value in it.

I felt a little out of my league at first, being a recent college grad managing such large projects, but I’ve always loved the opportunity to learn on my feet and prove myself. I really never have been one to remain within my perceived comfort zone, because I knew there was greater reward to be found beyond it.

Whatever the task, I always knew I would find a way to figure it out.
It wasn’t long before I began applying the streamlining techniques I had learned within previous roles to reduce State Farm’s yearly budget for an enterprise project from $3 million per year to $1.5 million. With these improvements, we were able to ramp up the project to include three releases per year instead of two, and develop a repeatable process that we could outsource to free up our onsite people for more strategic work within the company.

This was when I discovered my interest in improving project management and began to turn the page into Agile.

Here I was, just a young kid working at a huge company, managing multi-million-dollar projects, learning and adapting as I went, while aligning myself with mentors I knew could guide me in the right direction. Yet, I noticed a common theme across my colleagues: no one wanted to learn this new concept of “Agile”.
Why?
Because it was a new and unfamiliar approach. They were perfectly content sticking to their traditional methods, instead of considering that there might actually be a better way to do things.

My colleagues viewed this change as a threat, but I saw it as an opportunity to become an expert in a new, cutting-edge concept that others in my industry were afraid to touch.
I was ready to break the mold.
Following a few certifications and initial projects, I quickly became the go-to “Agile” person in the company, leading weekly lunch-and-learns to speak on delivering projects more effectively using Scrum.
Now, I speak all over the world on the importance of Agile, and I help train leadership teams and development teams across many countries and industries in implementing these processes into their businesses. I became one of only 220 Certified Scrum Trainers (CSTs) in the world. Then, my team and I discovered that applying Agile to Marketing yields incredible results in generating more revenue the way we see Agile applied to software development resulting in increased speed to market.
By learning and understanding how the Agile process worked, you could say I applied that same methodology to my life. I left the 9 to 5 world, have my own businesses, and get to travel to countries I never before dreamed of being able to visit."
Kevin Goldsmith,"Have used Agile techniques since 2000. Extreme Programming, Scrum, Kanban, Rational, etc.",2019,4,"Plenty of good and extensive answers here. Rather than repeat what has already been said multiple times, I will try to answer what I read as the spirit of your question instead of getting into the details of how Agile and Project Management interrelate. This is based on my experiences working for years in non-agile environments before switching to Agile development. I have a clear bias towards agile to be transparent.
Advantages of Agile for Project Management:
More flexibility - when working against uncertain deliverables or in a new area where you are exploring.
Deliver quickly - Since agile focuses on bringing value to customers faster and focuses on frequent releases it works well if you want to get something to your customers as fast as possible
Better team engagement - Agile focuses on leveraging the whole team for planning and reviewing, so you have better team engagement than in non-agile processes.
Disadvantages of Agile for Project Management:
Less predictable deliverables. If you have signed a contract with a customer for a specific set of functionality on a specific date, agile can be difficult to have confidence in making your commitment because it works forward instead of working backward.
Difficult to coordinate cross-team dependencies. Theoretically, with estimation, velocity and well-groomed public backlogs cross-team dependencies aren’t an issue. In reality, the number of companies trying to figure out how to scale their agile teams says otherwise.
Accountability to deliverables is more challenging. If you have a set of pre-agreed upon milestones and a team misses it then it is clear that they went wrong. In agile, establishing how well is working is its own challenge.
In my experience, the disadvantages all have reasonable solutions in a true agile cultured company. Also in my experience, the non-agile solutions to the disadvantages don’t really solve the problems either, they just make the issues more visible to leadership.
If your company doesn’t have a true agile culture, then the disadvantages are probably overwhelming."

Darren Thatcher,Agile Coach + Jira & Confluence expert (2010–present),2019,6,"Hi Jessica,
Thanks for your request for me to answer “What are the advantages and disadvantages of Agile as a project management tool?”
I’m an agile consultant, an agile coach and a scrum master so I should be able to answer this
“Agile” isn’t a project management tool: it’s a way of thinking and behaving, or - as we like to say - “mindset and behaviours”
It’s essentially:
an opening sentence about uncovering better ways of doing something but actually “doing” it as opposed to just talking about it, and in addition “helping others to do” it too
Four value statements
Twelve principles
The advantages are that if these values and principles were common across 17 successful people in the 1990s (the 17 signatories of the Agile Manifesto in 2001) and furthermore it’s stood the test of time since then, then they’re probably applicable today also, in the same way as the Lean principles have also stood the test of time.
I can’t think of any disadvantages. An analogy could be as follows: if a principle of a successful marriage was communication, then what would the disadvantage of communication be?
Agility teaches us certain mindsets and behaviours such as collaboration and valuing individuals and interactions more than valuing processes and tools; for example: before writing that email to your work colleague that sits just behind you, instead go and see if they want a coffee. This actually happened between two project managers that I was an agile coach for back in 2016: one had heard the other did reporting that the stakeholders really valued; when I suggested they talk the first project manager reached for his keyboard to write an email when the other sat just a few meters away. I paused him and said “Watch this…” and then went and invited the other if he fancied a coffee. I got them both talking over a coffee and the knowledge was shared. This was effective because “English language in written form is weak” (one of my many one-liners) and the sample I give in training to demonstrate this is: “I didn’t say I love you” and then I emphasise the various words: I didn’t say I love you; I didn’t say I love you; I didn’t say I love you; I didn’t say I love you; I didn’t say I love you (that last one kinda acts like the punchline to a joke - it always brings about a reaction in my class haha) but the point has been made. This is because communication between humans involves three components: words, voice intonation and body language. i go on to further demonstrate this by inviting my audience to reflect on how they found they’d proof read and correct emails they’d written to get that “perfect” communication, and then it still wasn’t received as the writer intended. Lesson learned: English language in written form is weak.
That last paragraph is just one small part of agility.
Such is the common sense of agility (and another one of my one-liners is “Agile is just a big slap of common sense”)
I still can’t think of any disadvantages :)"
Riley Claire,Software Test Engineer | Technophile | Blogger,2023,0,"While incremental delivery might assist get products to market faster, it is also a significant downside of Agile approach.

5 Key Disadvantages of Agile Methodology are as follows:
Poor resource planning
Limited documentation
Fragmented output
No finite end
Difficult measurement"
Chuck Cobb,Agile Project Mgt Author and Instructor (Over 200K Students),2018,11,"The biggest weaknesses in Agile/Scrum are not in Agile itself but in how it is implemented:
Agile “Zealotry” - Some people see Agile/Scrum as a “panacea” for any problem you might have and attempt to force-fit all projects to an Agile/Scrum approach. Agile is not a solution for every possible problem you might have.
Agile versus Waterfall Misconceptions - Many people think that there is a binary and mutually-exclusive choice between “Agile” and “Waterfall”. It is sometimes necessary to blend Agile and traditional plan-driven project management principles and practices in the right proportions to fit the situation. That is frequently true when you try to scale Agile to large, complex enterprise-level projects.
Agile requires training and should be done intelligently - Agile is intended to be adaptive and you should fit the approach to the nature of the problem but many people do it rigidly and mechanically because they don’t understand the principles behind it at a deeper level.
Development and Business Perspective - Many people see Agile from a “development perspective” and assume that whatever is good for the development process must be good for the business as a whole. Creating an enterprise-level Agile strategy needs to fit the nature of the company’s business and should be done in that context. It is not simply a matter of just forcing a company to become more Agile in many cases."

A Comprehensive Guide On Agile Development Process
Imagine a day in the programmer’s life in the early days of software development. The coding itself used to consume a lot of time, as the computers in those days were slow and heavy.
You had to sit in one place and complete the task. Collaboration was a difficult affair, and debugging could drain the developer completely.
The Agile Manifesto: 12 Principles
The guiding principles
The main priority for any software development company using agile practices is to offer continuous delivery of the software solution to exceed customer expectations.
You should say yes to changing the requirements even if it is suggested at the last minute of the development cycle.
You should ideally keep sending the working software to update the client on the progress. The timelines for that should be as short as possible, ranging from weeks to months.
Collaboration of the developers with the business development team is a must for better development processes and high-quality solutions.
Empower individuals so that they are motivated to complete the jobs. Offer a supportive environment for better delivery.
A face-to-face conversation with your development team is a must if you want to convey changes or communicate some aspect of the development.
A working software that you send to the client will help measure the progress of the project, and give your client an insight into what you are developing.
The development pace should be constant, which is why you need agile processes, as they offer a sustainable development environment.
Your development accelerates when you promote good design and technical superiority
You should incorporate simplicity in your development methods.
If you have a self-organizing team, as in the case of agile development, you will be able to incorporate the best architecture and designs for your project.
It is important to reflect on your actions, and the project to make it better and more effective.
Now that you are aware of the 12 principles of agile manifesto that you need to remember, let’s take a look at the best practices you should incorporate while developing using agile methodology.

Aadarsh Patel,"Lives in Pune, Maharashtra, India (2008–present)",2023,13,"The benefits of Agile
The benefits of Agile project management will vary from case to case, as different teams implement best practices their own way. However, it is generally understood that Agile offers the following core benefits:
1. Satisfied customers
By involving customers in the development process, Agile teams keep them in the loop and show that they value their opinion. Stakeholders want to be engaged throughout the project life cycle so they can offer feedback and ensure that the final product will be suited to their needs. These tailor-made deliverables will likely improve the overall user experience and boost customer retention.
2. Improved quality
Agile methodologies use an iterative approach to project management, meaning processes are improved upon each time an interval is repeated. This consistent focus on improvement and quality control is one of the core principles of Agile, and it helps to create superior products.
3. Adaptability
The central theme of Agile is flexibility. Agile teams are responsive to change, even at the last minute, and can adapt to it without much disruption. Project deliverables are not set in stone, so teams can easily reassess their plans and adjust their priorities to align with updated goals. Being adaptable means teams can deliver consistently and manage clients’ changing requirements effectively.
4. Predictability
Agile teams work in short time periods, sometimes referred to as sprints. These fixed durations (e.g., two weeks) make it easier for project managers to measure team performance and assign resources accordingly. It is also easier to predict costs for shorter time periods than for a long-term project, simplifying the estimation process.
5. Reduced risk
Developers regularly assess progress during sprints, meaning they have better visibility into the project and can spot potential obstacles quickly. These minor issues can be tackled before they escalate, creating an effective risk mitigation process and giving the project a greater chance of success.
6. Better communication
Agile teams prioritize face-to-face communication and continuous interaction. They will usually conduct daily meetings to ensure everyone is on the same page and working towards the same objectives. By regularly communicating with each other, they eliminate potential confusion to successfully achieve their objectives."

Look this image:
Here if you observe, in both cases we were building same product but difference is in approach.
Case-1:
You need to wait till end to get delivered the product. Till that you just have to wait… And even after that it’s not sure that you will get the product as you expected.
There might be gap in expectation and actual. And it’s obvious… The development team might have understood different as compare to your visualization. Or there might be reason that after so long duration, your requirement itself got changed (earlier you were expecting something but now it’s something else. As during this tenure you might have observed some newly came product in the market or evolved with new ideas in between).
Whatever be the reason but you are not happy with deliverable. Because of that we need to change it again. Which requires cost and time.
So as a whole if we summarize: then we can say till the date product deliver you kept in a blind fold. You are only investing money but not getting any output to use.
Case-2:
In case-2 , you are not required to wait till very end to get deliver the product. As here product development is divided in no. of iteration. So after each iteration you will get something to use. Which makes you start getting benefited from very beginning.
In addition to this, it will provide more advantages, like:
As you are getting deliverable after few days only, so you can re-view and give your feedback if any changes required. Because of that development team can make those changes easily as changing is easier at begging as compare to changing very end when every thing is buildUp. It will cost and time saving.
Margin of difference b/w actual and expectation will be thin.
Implementation cost is less
As you yourself involve from beginning itself so development will go on track
With small team size and resources we can build the product
Proper utilization of resources
Conclusion
As you can see, case-2 having lots of benefits as compare to case-1…
Right ?
This case-2 is nothing but Agile approach of building the product. Whose base line is MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
Agile methodology is iteration based model, dividing big requirements to small-small sub-requirements, prioritizing them (as per MVP) and developing them in phases (nothing but Sprints).
An iteration is the routine of developing small sections of a project at a time.
Each iteration is reviewed and assessed by the development team and client.
Key Features
Lower Cost
Encourages open communication among team members, and clients.

Nivedita,MBA from Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (Graduated 2020),2020,3,"I have been practicing agile for 7.5 years now and I can agree without a doubt that Agile so far has not disappointed me.
In my experience an Agile team works in 2-week sprints and delivers an MVP in monthly release cycles. Therefore there is early and continuous delivery of incremental versions of the software to the customer. Consequently, on this version of the software, the customer gives his feedback . This feedback is put into the MVP of the next month’s release cycle and delivered to the customer and the feedback cycle continues. Therefore, through monthly release cycles and delivering incremental versions of the software, agile takes both the development team and the customer to the version of the software that gives the most business value.
So yes, the most important benefit that Agile gives to the customer is maximum possible business value.
Other benefits of agile include
allowing the customer to change requirements
customer is involved throughout the development of the project through monthly demos
incorporating customer feedback enhances the quality of the product
Hope this helps.
Thanks.

Jaishree Goutam,"Student at IIT Delhi at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (2021–present)",2024-06,4,"Agile project methodology is an adaptive and collaborative approach to managing projects, especially in software development. It focuses on iterative progress through small, manageable increments called sprints. Agile promotes continuous improvement, flexibility, and responsiveness to change. Teams work closely with stakeholders, ensuring frequent feedback and adjustments. This methodology encourages cross-functional teamwork, regular communication, and a strong emphasis on delivering functional components quickly. Agile helps projects stay aligned with customer needs and adapt swiftly to evolving requirements, making it ideal for dynamic and complex environments. Its iterative nature allows for ongoing refinements and improved project outcomes.
Popular Agile methodologies include:
Scrum: Focuses on iterative development through sprints, with defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team) and regular meetings (Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Planning, and Retrospectives).
Kanban: Uses visual boards to manage workflow, emphasizing continuous delivery and improving efficiency by limiting work in progress.
Lean: Aims to maximize value by eliminating waste and optimizing processes. It focuses on delivering high-quality products with minimal resources.
Extreme Programming (XP): Enhances software quality and responsiveness with practices like pair programming, test-driven development, and frequent releases.
Feature-Driven Development (FDD): Involves developing software by building and designing individual features.
These methodologies help teams be flexible, responsive, and collaborative.

Leon Tranter,11 years working on enterprise IT systems,2023,0,"There are a bunch of pros:
Shorter lead time - people start getting stuff sooner. Instead of spending a long time writing up all the requirements and figuring out all the designs, you work in small batches, so something gets released much earlier.
More and faster feedback - since you are releasing in many smaller chunks rather than one big one, you can get more feedback and get it sooner, which helps you refine the products
Less handoffs - agile favours empowered cross-functional teams who own their technology stack - this means less handoffs, blockers, dependencies, etc.
Cons:
Harder to get stakeholder buy-in… stakeholders want up-front certainty and will struggle with the inherent uncertainty of this system
Architecture is a problem area - since we’re moving fast in small pieces, you figure out the architecture as you go, via “emergent design” - this can sometimes end up with messy architectures and spaghetti systems
Quality needs to be taken very seriously or the wheels will fall off - since you’re moving fast, it’s easy to fall into bad patterns and take shortcuts, leading to quality problems and technical debt."

Thom Snyder,"30 years project management, Writer, Quora contributor",2017,7,"This question seems to be the most perplexing question in the world of developers and one can go crazy reading the myriad of descriptions from several websites that promote themselves as experts on the subject.
Before launching into AGILE, let’s look at SCRUM and see if we can glean any information from that.
Let’s take for instance, information I gathered from ScrumAlliance.org:
What is Scrum? An Agile Framework for Completing Complex Projects - Scrum Alliance
The description of SCRUM was not what I expected, since according to the founders of Scrum, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, SCRUM is a methodology. One would assume that ScumAlliance.org didn’t get it right but should know what they are talking about. Then suddenly without warning, everything became a bit cloudier with their closing statement.
Now I was left guessing! Is SCRUM a process, a methodology (as I originally thought it was) or was it a framework?
Without going through the entire list, I’ll plug some additional info from The Definitive List of Software Development Methodologies - NOOP.NL website.
Scrum
Scrum is an agile project management methodology, created by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland. It all started in 2001 with The Manifesto for Agile Software Development, that defined the skeleton of four core values and twelve distinct agile principles. Throughout the years, Scrum has became the de facto standard for managing agile software development projects. One reason for Scrum’s popularity is that it consists of only a few common sense practices that can be applied in many situations. This also means that Scrum by itself is never enough, and that development teams have to incorporate other methods (usually XP) for additional practices.
Well, seems these people got it right. SCRUM is a methodology. Still, we should point back to the Manifesto for Agile Software Development itself to acquire the recommended enlightenment. Is there an answer in the 12 principles? I used this site as the reference, since it referenced the actual link to the Manifesto.
What's the Difference? Agile vs Scrum vs Waterfall vs Kanban
12 Principles of Agile Methodology
The Agile Manifesto lists 12 principles to guide teams on how to execute with agility. These are the principles:
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with preference to the shorter timescale.
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential.
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
Ok. There is nothing in the principles that distinguishes whether SCRUM or Agile is a methodology or a framework. The principles are nothing more than what they say they are - a manifesto. Google tells us that a manifesto is nothing more than a “… published verbal declaration of intentions, motives, platform or views of the issuer, be it an individual, group, political party or government.”
There is some information neatly tucked into 2 paragraphs on the History: The Agile Manifesto page of the Agile Manifesto which actually mentions SCRUM as a methodology.
“The Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact, many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology. [snipped for brevity] … Those who would brand proponents of XP or SCRUM or any of the other Agile Methodologies as ""hackers"" are ignorant of both the methodologies and the original definition of the term hacker.
[snipped for brevity] … A number (of) these articles referred to ""Light methodologies, such as Extreme Programming, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, and SCRUM"". In conversations, no one really liked the moniker ""Light"", but it seemed to stick for the time being.”
So I am convinced SCRUM is a methodology but what about AGILE? When we say Agile, are we mentioning a specific method called Agile or are we defining a methodology that is agile ?
The simple answer is: Agile is an umbrella term that includes other processes, like Extreme Programming, Kanban, Crystal, and Scrum. Scrum is Agile, but Agile isn’t Scrum.
Wow - that was a lot of writing. I need coffee."
Yuvaraj Mohite,Agile and Devops Coach,2021,0,The disadvantages are mostly people make it very prescriptive rather than understanding the guiding principles. Also it is a most common excuse to work ad-hoc under the guise of Agility.
Mike Graupner,"Progressive Christian, Conservative, Husband and Grandpa",2019,4,"What are the advantages and disadvantages of Agile as a project management tool?
Jesica,
Forgive me but I think the question has some bad assumptions. Project management is the process of management pr Schedule Scope and Cost.
Agile management is the process of managing a iterative development process Agile software development - Wikipedia
So, singe agile and Project management are different beast, the short ans is there are no advantage or disavantages, to the tools since they don’t cover any of the same areas
For example, in agile, schedule (iterations) is fixed which leads cost to be fixed as well. Scope is floating with the “you get what you get” type of approach.
So let's look at the dreaded PMBOK KA and how agile deals with them:
These are the 10 Project Management knowledge areas:
Project Integration Management.
Not sure if this can be mapped
Project Scope Management.
Not needed in agile as the product backlog management is scope management
Project Schedule Management.
- Schedule is fixed by the number of iterations being funded based on a fixed team size
Project Cost Management.
- Since the schedule does not “float” the costs are generally predictable
Project Quality Management.
- Since testing should be built into the iteration by the team quality is not “managed” by a PM
Project Resource Management.
- Fixed resources, no problems
Project Communications Management.
- Ideally the agile team is colocated, communication is face to face.
Project Risk Management.
- Hard to answer, I suggesting reading Who is responsible for risk management in Agile-style deliveries?
For me, I don’t look at the agile/waterfall debate as either one or another. My most successful projects have been blended projects. Agile has a lot of tools as work arounds.
A recent project was time critical and we could not get requirements. But using a agile/rapid prototype process in the front end, were were able to recover the schedule and deliver in on time (requirement were 3 weeks overdue in a 8 week schedule)
This being said, I would suggest you use an Agile tool for agile development and a project management tool for the project management
Hope this helps"
Aadarsh Patel,"Lives in Pune, Maharashtra, India (2008–present)",2023,1,"Cons of agile methodology
1. Transfer difficulties
When switching from one management style to another for an entire department, it may take time to fully acclimate to the new responsibilities and style of how projects progress within the system. Leaders may have some initial difficulties adjusting to the management style, although consistent practice and training can help all employees adjust to new tactics.
2. Variable goals
Because the agile methodology focuses on multiple goals at a time, certain goals may not receive as much focus throughout the entire project. Variable goals within a department can lead to a lack of specific goals for a team, which may lead to unknown deadlines and less accurate costs. One way to prevent variable goals from allowing unwarranted costs or missed deadlines can be to schedule regular meetings to discuss goals.
3. Lack of documentation
In the agile methodology system, documentation is less important than reactionary planning and progress. This can make documentation responsibilities such as record keeping, billing statements and plan-keeping complete more slowly in comparison to other duties. To help improve documentation while using this methodology, consider taking record of documented statements at least once a month.
4. Less documented improvement
Because agile methodology strategies focus on reactionary improvement rather than documented improvement phases, documented success and calculated methodology strategies may be ineffective throughout the project.
5. Goal focus shifting
Since agile methodology involves focus shifting based on which part of a project requires the most attention, it may be difficult to lead all team members toward a singular goal. In later stages of the project, it may become preferable to have the majority of department members focusing on a singular goal.
6. Less predictability
Because agile production relies on continuous improvement and customer feedback, the department may not be able to predict profits before production begins. Agile production focuses on sending acceptable products to customers as soon as possible, which can make potential issues harder to predict over time.
Pros of agile methodology
1. Timely delivery
Because it focuses on product placement, the agile strategy allows a department to deliver products to clients as quickly as possible. While products and development processes may not be as optimal as possible due to lessened planning stages, the agile method allows improvement to progress through reactionary feedback.
2. Adaptability
Since the improvement increments between product delivery dates are small, projects can easily change and adapt when underneath an agile strategy system. This allows production to continue at an acceptable rate while improving the process continuously.
3. Ease of collaboration
Because agile working requires much feedback between the client and employees, agile methodology introduces a great system for collaborating between both customers and other departments. In an agile system, management encourages employees to think creatively to solve problems and create solutions for project challenges as they arise.
4. Increased performance improvement
Because agile department test product increments as they produce them, department members can quickly react to problems as they may arise. The fragmented nature of production and correction allows agile departments to better understand and correct problems quickly.
5. Transparency
With the agile approach to departmental work, both potential issues and process improvements become evident with each production cycle. This type of management allows employees to both correct mistakes and improve production details quickly.
6. Continuous improvement
Because the agile department strategy relies on improving a process as it produces products, improvement can directly effect the next product. Additionally, because agile strategies don't stop production to implement fixes, management encourages employees to act on feedback as soon as possible.
7. Higher profits
The agile department focuses on producing a continuously improving product rather than a perfect one. This enables agile departments to gain profits as quickly as possible, since each product profit brings feedback back to the team.
8. Less preparatory work
Because agile development focuses on the product more than process improvement, an agile department can produce a product more quickly than other management methods. By accepting feedback and making changes over time rather than stopping production to make larger changes, products can improve while not fully compromising improvement efforts."
Roshan Bari,Information Technology Enthusiast,2023,53,"Agile is an approach to delivering an Information Technology or IT Solutions. The main focus is on changing Business needs and Technologies. Projects which are following Agile methodology having high rate of success.
There are many Software Development Methodologies available but Agile is one of most popular in industry. It is because nothing is permanent in Agile until the project has delivered a solution that is good and sufficient to the needs of its users.
Some of the major principles which are followed -
1. Early, continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Welcome the changing requirements
3. Working together daily throughout the project
4. Face to face conversation with team members
5. Encouraging the simplicity
There are various agile methodologies available, out of which Scrum is one of most followed methodology. Others are Lean, Kanban, XP, FDD, etc.
Peace :)"
Sundar Raghavan,"Lives in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",2019,1,"Adapting agile requires mindset and cultural change. We can follow agile, not just in projects even in our life aiding us to embrace changes, adapt to environment, and focus excellence. Agile helps our communication to be transparent and we tend to collaborate better. The outcome are value driven than process driven.
Below stated are major benefits from using agile:
The highest values are delivered first
Working product is a key focus than documentation
Advocates servant leadership and Scrum Master facilitate to remove impediments
Teams are self evolving and improvise themselves
Team trust each other and builds relationship to deliver stronger together
Deliver at regular intervals demonstrate to customer on what is being done from earlier stages onward
Accepts feedback and embraces changes
Reduces silos and breaks hierarchy encourages cross-functional team culture
Promotes continuous integration and delivery as outputs are seen earlier and feedback can be implemented at a later stages
Communication is frequent and regular to support the outcome"
Bob Dobbs,"Motorcyclist, photographer, and software developer",2019,1,"What is Agile? What are the benefits of learning it?
Agile: adj. able to move quickly and easily. Nimble.
If you have no uncertainty about outcomes or how to achieve them, you should not use agile development practices.
Examples: tying shoes. Boiling water.
If you never change priorities, you should not use agile development practices.
Agile development is the process of observing current state, identifying where you think you want to go, making a small change towards that direction, measuring how it affects your goal and if your goal is still valuable, and adjusting.
If you’re using agile as a noun, you’re selling something. It’s an adjective."
Cliff G.,"Technologist, Problem Solver, Product Manager, Lawyer, and all-around fun guy.",2018,3,"Absolutely! Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban are not silver bullets that just solve everything.
I think the biggest disadvantage of Agile methodologies lies not in the methods or processes themselves, but in the assumptions that underlie them, which many people ignore:
The business is accepting of proceeding with some level of uncertainty in the final outcome;
The development and quality assurance teams are ready to work together closely, rather than in staggered delivery/test/rework cadences;
Stakeholders across the business innately understand the process and how it will affect their delivery and expectations.
There are also some projects that simply aren’t really appropriate to apply an Agile approach against:
Mission-critical, “nine-nines” hardware or software that simply cannot go down, ever due to risk of loss of life or limb.
Regulated hardware that must be fully designed, reviewed, and approved by a state or Federal agency before it can actually be built.
Parallel development of hardware, software, and manufacturing facilities where a change in one causes effects of change in the others.
More often than not, when I’ve seen Agile transitions fail it’s not been because of the practices or methodologies “not working” but rather because people attempt to blindly implement them without really understanding the problems that they’re trying to solve or the impacts that their choices will have throughout the business.
Here are a few blog posts I’ve written on the subject:
Why Isn't Agile Working For Me?
What ""Agile"" Means to the Business
You're not Agile Unless You're ""agile""..."
Meenu Thariyan,"SEO Analyst, Business Research",2017,4,"Agile methodology is very flexible, adjustable and can adapt to the project needs. The project size is usually small however larger projects can also be handled using this. This methodology will use an incremental development strategy means that each successive version of the product is usable. Agile software development focuses on keeping code simple, testing often and delivering a functional unit as soon as possible.
In Agile model the developers should be knowledgeable, analytically strong, collated and collaborative. Agile projects involve the customer regularly, not just at the beginning and the end. This communication will help the customer to get an improved idea of the emerging product. The agile development can adapt changes easily.
This methodology involves continuous planning, testing, integration and other forms of evolution of the project. Each project is broken up into several iterations in the same time duration. At the end of each iteration a working product should be delivered. This will allows the customer to interact and work with functioning software at each successful iteration and provide feedback on it. This approach allows teams to take up changes more easily and make corrections if needed."
Mukund,Digital Marketing Executive at Iotasol (2021–present),2022,0,"In today's world, the agile approach has become one of the most widely utilized development methodologies. Agile techniques have been in use for over twenty years, and their rise has been particularly remarkable in the twenty-first century.
Agile technique provides several benefits for developing teams, which is why it continues to gain favor. Here are a few of Agile's most important advantages.
Agile Development's Advantages
Responding to Change
Adapting to Change The emphasis on responding to change and focusing on working on projects that matter when they matter is perhaps the most significant benefit Agile development approaches bring to development teams and businesses in general.
Uncertainty Acceptance
The second most important benefit Agile development delivers to an organization is that it accepts the fact that we don't know everything about a project when we start it.
Review Cycles that are Faster
Rapid iteration and cyclical, full assessments as work is finished are required for teams to be both accepting of uncertainty and responsive to change. This ensures that new discoveries are considered and present efforts are appraised.
Releasing Features with More Flexibility
The focus on providing working software in time-boxed or effort-boxed iterations of work gives the organization as a whole more flexibility in when a product should be given to end-users, in addition to faster cycles of review with customers or customers proxies.
Less Work Up Front
Product requirements were used to try to predict what will be needed in 6-9 months, but they also tried to be an encyclopedic contract covering and detailing practically every aspect of a product's design and development prior to the emergence of Agile development approaches.
Agile Development's Drawbacks
Lack of comprehension
The most significant disadvantage of Agile development is that the majority of individuals do not grasp what it means to be Agile. As a result, they form unfounded assumptions about what it means for both development teams and the company as a whole.
Bad Behaviors Can Result From Flexibility
Another typical issue coming from a lack of formal training or understanding is that Agile's flexibility can lead to teams participating in undesirable behaviors and ""blaming"" the resultant consequences on Agile rather than the dysfunctional decisions made by the team.
Appropriate Culture
Not every company's culture is ""ready"" for the changes Agile necessitates, which aren't limited to development teams, as many people believe.
Before making any major changes to your development ideology or adopting one for your firm, you should examine the values and beliefs you and your team have about product development. You'll also want to consider the facts of the product you're going to create."
Aaron Porter,A-CSM,N/A,24,"On what project? which agile methodology/framework? What is the organizational context? Does everyone that needs to know understand how to work within the methodology/framework? What type of work is being done?
The truth is that there may not be benefits to using a specific agile methodology or framework. There can be multiple variables that affect the effectiveness of using a specific approach. You are better off identifying the approach that will work best for your organization and the type of work to be done. Sometimes, a transformation is needed to achieve the best results, but it takes time to transform and begin to see the benefits. Many companies just aren’t patient or disciplined enough to fully realize the benefits of a transformation."
Muntaha Anjum,Content writer,2022,0,"Agile is most effective when:
You have no idea how much time you will need and do not know the entire spectrum of needs.
You have no idea whether your software is in demand on the market.
Because it is impossible to sketch out the business requirements, the design must emerge via trial and error.
You have unrestricted access to your consumer who is eager to participate fully.
You can iterate and do not have to offer completely working software all at once.
Neither you nor your customer have a complicated bureaucracy that causes decision-making to be delayed.
The Benefits of Agile Project Management
You can deliver software more quickly, allowing your customers to benefit sooner rather than later.
You utilize fewer resources since you constantly work on the most recent tasks.
You can better adjust to change and respond more quickly.
quicker turnaround times
You can find and correct problems and flaws more quickly.
You devote less time to paperwork and busywork.
You may share your knowledge with a large network of Agile practitioners.
You can get instant feedback (which also improves team morale)
You do not have to worry about premature optimization because developers may enhance their abilities depending on QA input.
The Drawbacks of Agile Project Management
Agile offers significant benefits, but it is also crucial to understand its drawbacks, limitations, and dangers.
Documentation often gets derailed, making it difficult for new members to catch up.
Because progress occurs across numerous cycles, it is more difficult to assess than in Waterfall.
Agile necessitates more time and energy from everyone since developers and clients must continually communicate with one another. When developers run out of work, they cannot work on another project because they will be required shortly."
Chuck Cobb,Agile Project Mgt Author and Instructor (Over 100K Students),2023,1,"In simple terms, Agile (Scrum) is a flexible and adaptive approach to development that uses an incremental and iterative approach to further define and elaborate both the requirements and the design as the project is in progress rather than starting a project with well-documented detailed requirements prior to the start of the project.
It is important because it is well-suited for projects with some level of uncertainty and many software projects have some level of uncertainty. In addition, it can reduce costs by eliminating unnecessary overhead and reduce time-to-market by streamlining the development process and delivering the solution incrementally."
Mark Jameson,Author has 60 answers and 98.5K answer views,2016,1,"When you have a proper working Agile team the follow advantages (over traditional waterfall approaches) will become apparent to you:
Teamwork
Agile teams work as one. Everyone on the team has to be committed and not just be involved (see Chicken and Pig fable). There is no hiding in an agile team.
Problems Spotted Early
Because of the nature of small iterations and developing features ready for production any problems are spotted early.
Minimal Disruptions
Agile teams work to a constant heartbeat. Disruptions from outside are easier to control and avoid. Because of tight deadlines and ever watching eyes of the team it is a lot harder for individuals to procrastinate.
Adaptable to changing Requirements
Until work has started on a story agile approaches accept that requirements may change and are open to this.
Effort Minimised
Most Agile methods encourage minimising the work you do.
They use concepts like:
- MVP (Minimal Viable Product)
- MMF (Minimum Marketable feature)
- YAGNI (You aren't going to Need It)
Quality Improved
Having a consistent approach to Acceptance Criteria of stories and definition of done improves quality.
Requirements Prioritised
Agile forces the team and its stakeholders to prioritise requirements and the order that features are worked on.
Most controlling methodology ever!! (In a good way)
If you think Agile is an excuse to cut corners and let developers hack systems togther then think again. A proper Agile team is like a well tuned factory and much more in control than any waterfall project is ever going to be.
Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)
Most agile teams practice the art of Kaizen.
State of the Art Dev Ops.
Agile projects demand state of the art development operations. Continouous Integration, Automated Unit Testing, ...
It is hard to run a proper agile team without using state of the art dev. techniques. Kaizen will eventually lead you to them."
Mark Levison,"Certified Scrum Trainer, Consultant (2009–present)",2021,0,"All work has many risks:
You will discover no one wants the thing you’re building
You will discover your team isn’t capable of doing the work with good quality
..or that their technical skills aren’t up to the job
You will discover that your team doesn’t like working together and you don’t gel.
Agile or not, all knowledge work has these risks. Agile approaches (there isn’t one ‘Agile’) will just force you to deal with them sooner."
