No, I’m joking. Scrum is awful, for me at least. I had witnessed only 2 implementations of scrum in my professional life, and both turned out to be highly bureaucratic and reduced productivity by wasting a lot of the developers’ time, and by inhibiting their creativity and autonomy. Some negative aspects include, and are not limited to:
1. It is advertised to empower business people - faster, more regular deliveries, they get to pick (and change at any moment) what gets worked on, they get estimates, therefore they c

https://www.quora.com/Do-programmers-really-like-Scrum,Jeremy Stafford,Software Engineer/Architect,2021,84,"I’ve always felt that the biggest problem with Scrum isn’t Scrum. It’s non-engineer type people trying to bastardize Scrum into something that works for them. We’ve had an uprising and have kicked managers out of the Scrum process and it has been amazing, so here’s my opinion on it:
Scrum is a development process, not a people management process
In short, separate the Scrum process from project management. Leaders will coordinate with each other, but they shall not intermingle processes, and engineers will only be involved with the parts in which they have a stake (like grooming or system design

Only people who likes it are (1) people who gets employment because of it, e.g. professional scrum master (whatever that means) or agile coaches (it does not mean anything - another free money role like diversity champion); or (2) People who needs the visual and perception of lot of work being done, without having to care about what actually is being done.

I’ve yet to experience it being done very well. In practice, it’s typically a little better than waterfall. In theory it should be a lot better.
Some issues with Scrum:
it can be an enabler for micro-management. Everything the team is working on has to be visible on the board. Really? This can act as a brake on some pro-active behaviors. Never mind logging time against stories etc. so we can claim those R&D tax offsets
Ceremonies? c’mon are we in a frickin’ cult?
does the whole team have to attend every ceremony? Really?
it relies on open and honest

If you are doing scrum, you are more than likely being subjected to a culture of micromanagement that prioritises short cuts and sloppy coding in order to achieve short term goals, because the burn down chart is far more important than the actual quality, robustness and maintainability of the product.
On top of this, there are all the pointless, pointless meetings that leave you with even less time to try to deliver on the total

If you put a competent technically-adept project manager or tech-lead in charge of the team, and if they have experience with similar projects, they will be able to deliver optimumly, in terms of both time and quality. They may or may not use an approach such as Scrum, but it is best to let the person with expertise select the paradigm that has worked for them in such cases.
Scrum is most useful when there are no experienced leaders on the team so you need to impose some kind of well-defined methodology. Oth

No, I don’t really like Scrum.
I really detest Scrum.
I observed so many flaws in the Scrum process/manifesto that it was literally painful.
Some, but not all, were:
The lie that Scrum would enable either faster delivery, more transparency or a better end product. The reality was that it seriously impeded delivery speed, encouraged less transparency and almost never produced any product at all (both projects were “cancelled” by executives).

I loved the original agile manifesto.
To me, that directly addressed the problems of uncertain, unpredictable development by attacking its root causes. Extreme Programming (XP) seemed to make a lot of sense.
These were ideas devised by programmers for programmers to help them program.
And then the project managers came along.
Scrum, with its planned sprints, seems to me to simply discard the agile manifesto. It splits a project into two week waterfalls and hijacks the term ‘agile’.
There is nothing in the agile manifesto that says we can make software more predictable. It’

Agile methodology is OK for tasks that are very well defined and are narrow in scope.
In my opinion Agile tends to focus people on the very short term and stifles creativity and innovation that do not align with the artificial Sprint boundaries, the same way stock prices focus companies on short term returns at the expense of long term strategies and goals.

Most programmers like to program. They want to know what needs to be done, that their work is contributing to the overall project and that no one else is doing the same thing, but after that they want to be left alone to program. Any group decisions are generally best made in chat (Slack) or in short, small meetings with only the people who need to be involved.

One word answer to this is a resounding NO. But it is not because of the poor methodology, but because of shoddy implementation of the concept in the real world.
Please bear in mind that Agile Manifesto was formed with the inputs given by the top practitioners in the tech space back in 2001. The research on the topic started way back in 1994 and the first research paper on it was published in 1995 by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber.

### The short answer
If specifically about Scrum, I myself did when I was developer, though I leaned more towards Kanban in actual practices. I liked looking forward for a few weeks, breaking things down into short term chunks, regular integration, and looking at our process and making changes on a regular basis.
I coach a lot of teams, and have found the same pattern holds up. Developers tend to lean towards Kanban, with regular planning and retro opportunities. Similar to other pos

It’s a statistical average. It also represents the statistical average of well-done Scrum vs. poorly done Scrum.
When done right, it does give trust and authority to the programmers. It increases motivation and effectiveness. It does require that the team learns new skills (which may be uncomfortable for some people), but once those skills become more natural, they further increase the team’s ability. In these teams, the ScrumMaster is a liked person and really does help the team improve and get things done better & smarter. The ScrumMaster

Programmers are smart people and can easily recognize when they are being asked to do dumb things that are a waste of time. So no, they don't like scrum about 85% of the time.
The #1 problem in scrum is the non-customer product owner anti-pattern. Scrum works well when there is a savvy customer who will engage and learn what good looks like. The reason this works well is that team has coupled itself to a reliable source of truth so they can iterate into t

Everybody seems to do some bastardized process they call scrum, which they hate.
When I was first introduced to the concept, we were pretty gung ho about it. People actually tried to size tasks properly, groom backlog, break stories into tasks, and track the progress of stories toward completion within the sprint. The manager always had a burndown chart on his wall.

However, like any methodology it can be abused, and Scrum is easier to abuse than most. It requires a lot of discipline, just as being a member of a crew team requires individual and collective discipline.
Some people think you can just call your daily meeting a “stand-up” and suddenly you’re doing Scrum. I have seen this more than once, and it’s worse than waterfall. Most of the criticism of Scrum seems like visceral reactions to the fake “stand-up-only” version, in my opinion.

It is unfortunate that majority of the Scrum Masters or coaches who introduce it or accountable for its right adoption themselves have very limited or skewed understanding of it.

The most important part of any agile process is the introspection part, Scrum is not some fixed thing that remains in a static state for all eternity.

Would disagree with the statement that scrum is an utopian methodology. Agile is challenging to implement and Scrum isn’t an exception. Not only it can be counter-intuitive, but also because it raises questions regarding the whole process. It’s always easier to shove the questions under the carpet, but it won’t be Agile anymore.
